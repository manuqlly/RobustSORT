# RobustSort-
RobustBoxTracker is a lightweight object tracking algorithm that matches bounding boxes using area, position, and aspect ratio similarity. It supports re-identification of lost objects, making it ideal for real-time video tracking in low-resource environments without deep learning or Kalman filters.
